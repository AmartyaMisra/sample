## Managed Kubernetes:

Third-party providers assume responsibility for successful K8s setup and operation, relieving you of certain or all associated tasks. "Managed" can encompass dedicated support, hosting with pre-configured environments, or complete hosting and operation, contingent on the vendor.

## Kubernetes' Built-in Features:

Encompasses scalability, detached credential configuration, self-recovery, workload management, batch execution, and progressive application deployment. These features demand substantial manual configuration.

## Managed Solutions' Power:

These solutions handle configuration or guide decision-making, simplifying the setup process. Once operational, they automate routine tasks like updates, scaling, load-balancing, and monitoring. When coupled with a hosting platform, managed Kubernetes services manage maintenance and configuration of your infrastructure.

Experience Kubernetes' potential with managed solutions, where excellence is curated with simplicity, automation, and attentive care.
